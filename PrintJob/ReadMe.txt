A "job" is a group of print items.For example,
a job can be a run of business cards, envelopes, and letterhead together.

Some items qualify as being sales tax free, whereas, by default, others
are not.Sales tax is 7%.

Also applies a margin, which is the percentage above printing
cost that is charged to the customer.  For example, an item that costs $100 
to print that has a margin of 11% will cost:
item: $100 -> $7 sales tax = $107
job:  $100 -> $11 margin
total: $100 + $7 + $11 = $118

The base margin is 11% for all jobs this problem.Some jobs have an
"extra margin" of 5%.  These jobs that are flagged as extra margin have
an additional 5% margin (16% total) applied.

The final cost is rounded to the nearest even cent.Individual items are
rounded to the nearest cent.
